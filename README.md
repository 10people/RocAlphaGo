# Current project status

Development is being carried out on the `develop` branch. We use Python and Keras - a decision to prioritize code clarity over speed, at least in the early stages of development.

See the wiki page on the [training pipeline](https://github.com/Rochester-NRT/AlphaGo/wiki/Neural-Networks-and-Training) for information on how to run the training commands that have been implemented so far.
